# Work Life Balance

Do you need work / life balance or do you need to find your life's work?

It's common for today's church message to focus on burnout, striving, avoiding the hustle and bustle of work culture. It's suggested that you ought to spend your time in prayer, solitude, and worship. Secular culture has a similar message which is approximately: work / life balance. There are several caveats that I would like to present along with this --seemingly good-- message:

1. I'm not suggesting rest, solitude, time with God, time with family, time with friends is bad. However, I am suggesting that those things are not sufficient for a life well lived.

2. Each created person has been given talents. You will be most satisfied with your life when you discover and use the talents. Using the talents requires hard work. But when you are using your talents, it won't seem like work. You will feel that you are giving your all to accomplish the unique task that God has given you. This, along with Peace, family, and friends will give you a life worth living.

3. Don't let a paycheck keep you away from your talents. If you feel burnt out, robbed, depressed; find God in the secret, quiet place, but also find your talents and put them to work. Don't let the evil corporate slave masters steal your creative juice. I think college was supposed to help solve the problem of talent discovery, but it doesn't do that anymore. Do whatever you can to position your self in alignment with your talents and then give 'er all you got!


Rest is necessary but not sufficient for a life well lived. You need to put your talents to work. Finding God is half the battle, the other half is finding your self. Once you have those two things you can start to live.
