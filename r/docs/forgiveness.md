# continuing forgiveness

> Matthew 18:21

> Then Peter came up and said to him,
> "Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?"
> Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times."

> Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.

> So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, "Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything." And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.

> But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, "Pay what you owe." So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, "Have patience with me, and I will pay you." He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt. When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place.

> Then his master summoned him and said to him, "You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?" And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt. So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.‚Äù

> Collosians 2:13

> And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.

> Lamentations 3:21

> ...But this I call to mind,<br />and therefore I have hope:<br />
> The steadfast love of the Lord<br />never ceases;<br />
> his mercies <br />never come to an end;<br />
> they are new ever morning;<br />
> **great is your faithfulness.**<br />

Thank you, Jesus for cancelling our debt.<br />
Thank you, Father for new mercy each morning.<br />
Holy Spirit, come let us love and forgive our brothers and sisters.
