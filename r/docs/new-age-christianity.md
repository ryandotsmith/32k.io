# New Age Christianity

Do you practice mindfulness? Have you worn a crystal around your neck to stimulate your immune system? Are breathing exercises and meditation routine parts of your day? Perhaps one of your friends manifested gold dust or began levitating during contemplation.

If any of that sounds familiar and if you also believe that Jesus is the creator and sustainer of all things and that His beautiful relationship to Father and Holy Spirit is now made available to everyone, then you've probably been accused of being a new age christian. I wonder: is that so bad?

Don't get me wrong, I take a strong stand against witchcraft and divination. Jesus said the only way into the fold is through Him. He is the gate. Sure, you can sneak in some other way, but there is a cost for entering on your own. *But let's get back on topic.*

Is it possible that Jesus made crystals to be harmonious and healthy for our bodies? The Buddha believing brothers and sisters popularized the practice of mindfulness, should we then completely abandon the technique? I'm not sure what David Blaine is doing, but could it be that divine ascension is a holy practice?

I would propose that certain new age techniques have become popular because the essence benefits the human heart. I would further suggest that we as Christians should be open to new experiences --as Holy Spirit, community, and scripture guide us. When we follow Jesus into mindfulness and meditation, we are entering into a world of untold wisdom and delight! When we thank Jesus for crystals and other minerals that help our body, we are dancing with Him and His beautiful creation to the tune of The Restoration of All Things!

Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. --John

If we take the term *new age* at face value then Jesus is the most new age person that has ever walked the earth. When the Word became flesh, we entered a new age. The old age has passed away; behold all thing have become new.

Don't let religion hold you back from living an abundant life full of meditation, mindfulness, healthy breathing, natural medicine, ecstatic trances, supernatural healing, and seeing into the future.

But don't get lost either! Jesus is not a means to an end. He is the beginning and the end. We don't move on to greater things. Meditation, experiences, creation are all things that point to Him.
