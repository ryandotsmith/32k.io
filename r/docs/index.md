## Favorite Quotes

"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."

*--Robert Heinlein, Time Enough for Love*

"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."

*--African Proverb*

"The business world ‚Äìwhere the majority of American men live and die‚Äì requires a man to be efficient and punctual. Corporate policies and procedures are designed with one aim: to harness a man to the plow and make him produce. But the soul refuses to be harnessed; it knows nothing of Day Timers and deadlines and P&L statements. The soul longs for passion, for freedom, for life."

*--John Eldredge, Wild at Heart*

"It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting,"

*--Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist*

"And don‚Äôt worry about losing. If it is right, it happens‚ÄîThe main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good gets away."

*--John Steinbeck, A Letter to His Son*

When Rabbi Zusha was on his deathbed, his students found him in uncontrollable tears. They tried to comfort him by telling him that he was almost as wise as Moses and as kind as Abraham, so he was sure to be judged positively in Heaven. He replied, "When I get to Heaven, I will not be asked Why weren't you like Moses, or Why weren't you like Abraham. They will ask, Why weren't you like Zusha?"

*--Rabbi Meshulam Zusha of Hanipol*
