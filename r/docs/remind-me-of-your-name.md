# Remind Me of Your Name

I was hanging out in Golden Gate Park when I began conversing with a homeless teenager who had been living in the park. We must have talked for over an hour. We laughed, cried, prayed, and basically enjoyed each other's company. Towards the end of our conversation, I ashamedly told the stranger that I had forgotten his name. He looked at me and said, "Dude," he didn't remember my name either, "I am likely to never forget our conversation on this beautiful day. Wouldn't you rather it that way instead of me just knowing your name?" I replied "Right on, man." and we went on our ways.
