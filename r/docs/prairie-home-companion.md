After a wild night in Lawrence Kansas, spending the night with friends from public school --namely Kyle Jones and Dawn Coleman. I was driving my trusty old explorer back to Kansas City. I was living downtown at the time. As a drove the I-70 east at dawn, I flipped though radio stations to find something to cheer me up. I had a crush on Dawn but could never make anything of it. That morning I took my convalescence in the form of public radio. I heard dusty and lefty for the first time. It blew my mind. I had never thought that a radio drama could capture so much of my attention. I was lost in their story --albeit a silly one. I soon realized that this radio drama aired live every Saturday evening. It was filled with bluegrass and ol' timey music, story tellin', and the calming, creative voice of an old man named Garrison Keillor.

This year, Garrison retired from the radio show.
