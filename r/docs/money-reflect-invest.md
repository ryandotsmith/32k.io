# Money is a Reflection - Investing

One of the things I love most about investing is that it gives your heart a mirror. When you reflect on why you want more money and what you'll do with it, you get a unique glimpse into your heart. Money isn't the only mirror you have into your heart; things like relationships, families, hobbies will give you insights, but money is often overlooked as a source of heart inspiration. 

I have been waking up to new realities exposed by the way I earn, spend, and invest. My reflections on my thoughts and behaviors towards money have helped me grow in my relationships and provided improved return on investments. Taking a good, brave look at your money can be a scary but extremely rewarding endeavor!

I'll write about my experience in the realms of earning and spending later, but for now I'd like to share some contemplative questions that I meditate on prior to investing:

### How am I feeling when I invest

* Do I feel taken care of?
* Am I being patient?
* Am I in a rush?
* Do I feel comfortable explaining my investments to a friend?
* Am I feeling anxious?
* How often am I checking my phone?
* Am I present in conversation when I have trades open?
* Do I feel wise?
* Do I have a good gut feeling or a bad gut feeling?

### Motivation for Investing

* What do I want from this experience?
* Am I making a trade to exercise my decision making process?
* Am I making short term trades to fund a purchase?
* Am I looking for long term savings growth for a future family?

### Picking Things to Invest in

* What does this company do?
* Have I purchased their product? Do I enjoy it?
* Do I like their CEO? Would I want to work there?
* Is the price of a share over or under valued?

### Buying a Position

* Am I making an investment in the future?
* Am I speculating for a short term profit?
* Do I feel like I'm throwing darts at a board?
* If the price of this position declines, can I wait until it recovers?
* How long will I hold this position?

### Selling a Position

* Am I selling at a loss? If so, how come?
* What will I do with the proceeds?
* How much tax will I owe on the gains?
* How will I feel if the position increases substantially tomorrow?
