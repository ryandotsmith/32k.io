# I Wish to Enjoy an Oak Tree

As I sat on my front porch, drinking a glass of scotch and smoking a fine cigar, I thought that it would be nice to have an oak tree. The trouble is that I find oak trees most enjoyable when they are about 90 feet tall and full of leaves. You see, for an oak tree to be 90 feet tall and full of leaves it must have endured a considerable amount of time --about 30 years. Thus my current desire for an oak tree is quite impossible. Knowing my desire for oak trees leads me to a single conclusion; I must plant an oak tree now so that in 30 years I won't have to repeat this mistake. However, as I mentioned, I was enjoying scotch and everyone knows you can't simply plant an oak tree while being high on scotch.

Now, I don't really care that much for oak trees. The oak tree is a nice way to think about things in life that are valuable. For instance, consider a friendship. Like the oak tree, a good friendship takes time to grow. However, opposite to the oak tree, friendships do quite well with scotch.
