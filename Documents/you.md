# you

our conversation chases <br /> french light cast shadows –body traces <br /> in my mind i see years, love <br /> and tears –your smile erases

even though our faces exchange gazes <br /> i wonder if i'm too far ahead –i can't keep paces

i wait but one day i hope to see you in laces <br /> look at me already off to the races
