# rest for my soul

when shame and hate creep on my soul <br /> and i'm wont to take the darkness head on <br /> and i hold my sorrow <br /> and i don't believe that it is good to give this pain to Jesus

that's when His love washes over me <br /> that's when His voice, <br />sounding like rushing waters, <br />says **I love you** <br /> that's when i hear <br /> **you are the one that I want**

and i weep in thankfulness and joy <br /> because i feel the ease of the yoke <br /> and the weightlessness of my burden
