don't be clever<br />
ask, learn, teach<br />
code is a liability<br />
design and architecture matter<br />
first make it correct then make it fast<br />
only make it fast if you know it matters<br />
it's not done until customers are getting value<br />
it's not done until there's nothing left to take away<br />
don't automate something you haven't done manually<br />
quick incremental progress is better than the alternative<br />
code is shared by the team. there is no such thing as my code<br />
it's easier to change a dry-erase board than a production system<br />
code is written to be understood by humans first, computers second<br />
