# busted outside king city

![king city](https://cl.ly/0S1J1L1S3S2K/IMG_0458.jpg)

Riding the 101 back from Los Angeles. My whole body ached.

On Monday I rode from San Francisco to visit my friend Beau. He asked Jill to marry him. She said yes. So they threw a party on Tuesday night and I couldn’t miss it. The ride down south nearly took me out. My ass hurt, my back hurt; I wasn’t particularly looking forward to the ride back to Frisco on Wednesday.

I woke up at 8am --a little groggy from the fantastic engagement party-- on Wednesday knowing there was 500 miles of riding ahead of me. After I finished my morning coffee, I slogged my aching bones to the motorcycle and began the journey home. The first hundred miles where the worst. The traffic, the smog, the rain. Yet I knew that the only way back home was with this tired body on this old motorcycle. As my body became numb I began to give in to the ride – something like a runner’s high. As I hit a couple hundred miles, I had a sadistic grin on my face. I had overcame the pain. I was in freeway nirvana.

As I rode up to King CIty, the sun was on my shoulders, the engine was humming; all was right with the world. I thought it might be nice to take a break and get some fuel. It was in this moment that I heard my engine coughing. I was out of gas. I flipped the reserve but nothing was there. I was busted half a mile outside of King City.
